# Linear Additive Markov Processes

This directory a modified implementation of and experimental code for
["Linear Additive Markov Processes", WWW 2017, Ravi Kumar, Maithra Raghu, Tamás Sarlós, and Andrew Tomkins](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01255).

This modifications here are used to save estimated LAMP transition matrices. We use these in the paper [URL pending]() to estimate entropy for LAMP models of the data sets presented in Ravi et al., using the code located in the following repository https://github.com/bridget-smart/LAMPEntropyEstimates.

For more information, see the implementation from the original paper at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/lamp, or for more details regarding entropy estimates see https://github.com/bridget-smart/LAMPEntropyEstimates.

# Linear Additive Markov Processes

This directory a modified implementation of and experimental code for the paper

[Ravi Kumar, Maithra Raghu, Tamás Sarlós, and Andrew Tomkins. "Linear Additive Markov
Processes", WWW 2017.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01255).

This modified code is used to save the calculated LAMP transition matrices, and used in the paper <URL pending>. These transition matrices are used to calculate entropy estimates, using the code located in the following repository https://github.com/bridget-smart/LAMPEntropyEstimates.

For more information, see the implementation from the original paper at github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/lamp, or for more details regarding entropy estimates see https://github.com/bridget-smart/LAMPEntropyEstimates.
